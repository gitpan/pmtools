In no particular order, here are some of my goals for pmtools:

* Fix plxload, which does not work for me under Cygwin.
* Investigate CPAN module manipulation packages for use
  in additional pmtools.
* Add the "pmtools" command sent me by Matthew Persico.
* Fix podgrep -i so it actually works again.
* Fix pmfunc so it actually works again.
* Add tests for modules.
* Remove Makefile.lame.
* Add support for running the programs under Windows.
  Probably want to wrap them in batch files for maximum
  portability.
* Add tests for the modules.
* Solicit other ideas from Perl community members.
