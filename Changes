v1.10  2008-01-18 06:57:21 EST  Mark Leighton Fisher
  - Added copyrights in my name as well as Tom Christiansen.
  - Changed to dual-license like Perl: GNU and Perl Artistic.
    This was at the request of the Fedora project, as they
    wanted a version of pmtools licensed under GNU.

  - Added Changes and TODO files.
