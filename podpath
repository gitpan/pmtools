=head1 NAME

podpath - print the path to the pod

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is just a front-end that calls either I<stdpods>
or I<pmpath> depending on what it looks like.  It works
on both regular the standard podpages and the module ones.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    $ podpath Cwd
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/Cwd.pm

It works with alternate installations, too:

    $ devperl -S podpath perlfunc
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/pod/perlfunc.pod

    $ oldperl -S podpath IO::Handle
    /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00404/IO/Handle.pm

    $ filsperl -S podpath Thread
    /usr/local/filsperl/lib/5.00554/i686-linux-thread/Thread.pm
